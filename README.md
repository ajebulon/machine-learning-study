# Machine Learning with only Numpy
This repo is a collection of my journey while studying machine learning. I think that the basic things about how Machine Learning is important and everyone should study this before jumping into the famous ML/AI framework such as Tensorflow & PyTorch. I added some explanation about how things works and the intuition behind it. I hope it's helpful enough to explain.

Enjoy!
